🌳 Decision Tree Implementation using Scikit-Learn

This project is part of the CODTECH Data Science / Machine Learning Internship (Task-1).
The objective is to build, train, evaluate, and visualize a Decision Tree model using Python and Scikit-Learn.


--------------------------------------------------------

📌 Project Overview

A Decision Tree is one of the most powerful and intuitive supervised machine-learning algorithms used for classification and prediction tasks.
In this project:

A dataset is loaded (Iris dataset)

The data is split into training and testing sets

A Decision Tree Classifier is trained

The trained tree is visualized using plot_tree()

Model accuracy is evaluated


This notebook provides a clean, simple implementation for beginners.
